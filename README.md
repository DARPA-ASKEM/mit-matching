# mit-matching
This repository contains examples of how to use the REST API developed by the MIT team to match related data in different formats. 

This API was first made available during the January Hackathon and it is still preliminary. Our goal is to gather feedback on how to improve it. 

Please reach out to one of us to obtain the IP address with which to poulate `api_ip_addr.py`. 

You will also need a valid key for GPT-3, with which to populate `gpt_key.py`. You can sign up for such a key [here](https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup/identifier?state=hKFo2SBxcUY4QTBQSVlNSjdRVDRjTGRhZ2lQdUpDeEZUMEhMOKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIHh2VzlwQjFWMnItb05pVjJiNERqUWtFMzZ1VnhpOEJao2NpZNkgRFJpdnNubTJNdTQyVDNLT3BxZHR3QjNOWXZpSFl6d0Q).
